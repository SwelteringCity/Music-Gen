# Music Generator Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Music Generator project using machine learning. The project aims to generate music compositions using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

The Music Generator project utilizes a deep learning model trained on a dataset of musical compositions. The model learns the patterns and structures in the music and can generate new compositions based on the learned patterns.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Music Generator project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-generator.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python (version X.X.X) and the following libraries installed:

   - Library 1
   - Library 2
   - Library 3

   You can install the dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare the dataset. Download the dataset of musical compositions and place it in the `dataset/` directory. Preprocess the dataset if required.

4. Train the model. Run the training script `train.py` to train the deep learning model on the dataset. Adjust the hyperparameters and settings in the script as needed.

5. Generate music. Once the model is trained, you can use the `generate.py` script to generate new music compositions based on the learned patterns. Adjust the generation parameters and settings as desired.

## Directory Structure

- `dataset/`: Contains the dataset of musical compositions.
- `models/`: Stores the trained models and checkpoints.
- `scripts/`: Contains the Python scripts for training the model and generating music.
- `utils/`: Includes utility functions and helper scripts.
- `examples/`: Provides examples of generated music compositions.
