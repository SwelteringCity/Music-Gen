- [ ] Research and gather relevant datasets of musical compositions
- [ ] Determine the specific goal and scope of the project
- [ ] Define the desired output format for the generated music (e.g., MIDI files, audio files)
- [ ] Set up a development environment with Python and necessary libraries
- [ ] Plan and design the directory structure for the project
- [ ] Create the necessary directories in the repository (e.g., `dataset`, `models`, `scripts`)
- [ ] Research and choose a suitable deep learning framework/library (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- [ ] Install the chosen deep learning framework/library and any other required dependencies
- [ ] Write the data loading and preprocessing functions to prepare the dataset
- [ ] Define the architecture of the deep learning model for music generation
- [ ] Implement the training script (`train.py`) to train the model on the dataset
- [ ] Test the training script and ensure it produces satisfactory results
- [ ] Implement the generation script (`generate.py`) to generate music using the trained model
- [ ] Set up the necessary configuration and parameters for generating music
- [ ] Test the generation script and ensure it produces valid and desirable music compositions
- [ ] Document the project, including a comprehensive README file explaining the project and its usage
- [ ] Write a license file specifying the project's license (e.g., MIT License, Apache License)
- [ ] Create an examples directory (`examples`) to showcase generated music compositions
- [ ] Write acknowledgments to any contributors or datasets used in the project
- [ ] Test the entire project thoroughly, addressing any issues or bugs that arise
- [ ] Seek feedback from users and the community, and make necessary improvements based on the feedback
